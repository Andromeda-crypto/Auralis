# Auralis
Auralis is an adaptive system that learns from its environment to optimize energy usage and avoid inefficient behaviors. It starts as a simulation of a smart energy node, but the platform is designed to scale into multi-node networks and eventually interact with robotic hardware, bridging AI intelligence with physical systems.
